## Project Structure

The project structure follows a common React application structure, with the following main directories:

- `src/components`: Contains reusable components used throughout the application.
- `src/pages`: Contains the main page components.
- `src/store`: Contains Redux store setup and reducers.

The styling is done using Tailwind CSS, and the configuration for Tailwind CSS can be found in the `tailwind.config.js` file. Feel free to customize the styles by modifying this configuration file.
